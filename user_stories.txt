# Define Key Words
Reservation —> has a date and time and location, party size

# Tough Decisions about Making Reservations
-Length of reservation
-Seats vs. tables
-Who gets seated first?
-Time of reservations
-Other types of reservations (phone, walk-ins, etc.)
-Table layouts

# Planning
Make Assumptions (Solving the Tough Decisions)
     -Available reservations based on seats, not tables
     -Reservations are only one hour in length
     -Only one type of reservation (online)

# Simplify
     -Instead of diner and restaurant owners, just make one type
